üéâ Completion of ft_transcendence 42 Network Project! üåê
After several months of dedicated hard work and diving into new technologies, I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of my final project for the 42 Network Common Core. Working alongside my exceptional teammates, @Ayoub and @Yassin, we collaborated to create a dynamic gaming experience that truly embodies the spirit of innovation.
This journey has provided me with invaluable practical experience in web development. Here are some key contributions I made to the project:
API Design: Developed APIs to ensure seamless communication between the client and server, maintaining smooth gameplay.
User Authentication: Implemented secure methods to protect player information and uphold account integrity.
Data Management: Utilized PostgreSQL for data storage, effectively managing user profiles and game scores to ensure reliability.
Backend Development: Leveraged Django as the backend framework to increase development speed and enhance performance.
Real-Time Responsiveness: Managed asynchronous operations to guarantee smooth gameplay and responsiveness, even under heavy loads, by utilizing WebSockets for real-time data transmission.
Microservices Architecture: Adopted a microservices architecture to enhance modularity and facilitate the independent deployment of different components.
